# **A/B-testing**
The goal of this project is to analyze the results of multiple A/B tests using statistical methods in Python and to create interactive visualizations in Tableau that display key conversion metrics.

## **Analysis Overview**

The A/B test analysis was performed for four separate tests, both at the total level and across the following dimensions:
* Continents
* Device types
* Traffic channels

The project includes the calculation of conversion metrics that represent different stages of the user journey on the website:
* Adding an item to the cart
* Beginning the checkout process
* Providing shipping information
* Providing payment information
* Creating a new account

Statistical significance for each metric was evaluated using hypothesis testing, and results were summarized for every test and test group.

## **Tableau Visualizations**

[A/B testing]
([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olena.sapohova/viz/AB_testing/ABTesting])

The Tableau dashboard presents:
* Overall metric calculations and statistical significance results for each test
* Separate pages with detailed visualizations for each test broken down by continent, device type, and traffic channel
* Distribution of users between A and B groups for each test, both in total and across continents, countries, devices, and traffic channels

## **Results**

The project includes:
* Detailed conclusions for each test
* Identification of statistically significant improvements or declines in conversion metrics
* Insights by continent, device type, and traffic channel
* Recommendations for further actions based on the observed results
